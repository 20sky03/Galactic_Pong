WHAT IS PONG?

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis.
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across
the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another
player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use
the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player
to reach ten points before the opponent; points are earned when one
fails to return the ball to the other.

Why did I decide to make the pong remake?

After learning different ways in which you can use various languages
to create different things like C, Python, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java,
I found that it is really cool to implement my skills in creating games
which everyone loves. I came across Lua which uses an engine called LOVE2D.
Lua has the same framework as Python and Javascript. It is developer
friendly too because it gives us various tools to make User Experience better.

Games like Pong, Pacman, Snake, SuperMarioBros., Angry Birds,
etc were a big part of my childhood as I was introduced to these
first by my parents while growing up.
Finding out that I can make these games too, using the skills I developed during this course
overwhelmed me.
So I got excited to remake Pong with an intergalactic twist!
